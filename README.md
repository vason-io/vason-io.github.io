## 📄 Development conventions

- Use official palette generator for generating a color
  scheme: https://docusaurus.io/docs/styling-layout#styling-your-site-with-infima
- Use standard `996px` value for media query breaking points. Due to limitations of standard CSS variables, we can not
  use them in media queries, hence we have to hardcode them for now
